DAVAR DIALER

I am looking to build an app that can do the following;

I can upload excel spreadsheets. The system (using Twilio) will call these numbers, detect if the number is still working, answered by a human being and or if it hits an answering machine. Compile this data and make it ready for a salesperson. 

We will "eventually build this into a custom CRM I am building so that if a live customer is available the salesperson can call them right away! and or be connected to the customer. A CUSTOM calling system.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks

p.s. I need to know how long it would take to build and what you think if would cost to implement.
